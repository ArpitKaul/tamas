  description: `Zane Calder had never been the adventurous type. He lived a quiet life in a small town tucked away somewhere in India — the kind of place where nothing ever really happens. But lately, the noise had been growing louder: work, people, deadlines, pressure. So when his friends suggested a few days away — just them, camping deep in the jungle — Zane agreed. No phones, no lights, no one else for miles. It was supposed to be peaceful. A break. A laugh. A story to tell when they came back.
  But they weren’t just escaping the noise — they were crossing into something else. A place no map shows. A place that doesn’t follow the same rules.At the center of it all was a name whispered in the dark: Tamas. Some say he’s a man. Others say it’s a place. Maybe neither. Maybe worse.Because in that jungle, something was waiting. Not a creature. Not a ghost. Not something you could see — or run from.
It was quiet. Still. Watching.And in the silence... it moved.`

    description: 'Nayra Kael doesn’t chase adventure — she chases the truth. Smart, composed, and relentlessly curious, she’s spent her life running from the silence around her father’s disappearance. But when she discovers a photo of him hidden in a blank book — with one word written on the back: Tamas — everything changes. No history book mentions it. No map shows it. And yet, it’s pulling her deeper into something far older and darker than she ever imagined. Some say Tamas is a place. Others say it’s a person. Some believe it’s neither — just a doorway that should never be opened. Whispers follow her. Time bends near it. The deeper she digs, the more she questions what’s real. Tamas doesn’t want to be found — but something inside it is waiting. She’s not chasing legends anymore. She’s chasing something that remembers her name. And the closer she gets, the less she’s sure she’ll come back as herself. Because some doors don’t just open — they pull you through.'

Zane,

If these words have found you, then the seal has broken...

Light is both your guide and your curse. Every flicker awakens what once slept beneath silence — memories carved in ash and whisper.

This place is older than time’s reckoning. It remembers you, even if you do not remember it.

Do not speak aloud what you read here. The walls listen. The ink bleeds truth only for those who walk the border of shadow and flame.

Seek the mark beneath the blackened stone.
Speak the name only when the wind stands still.
And when the candle weeps — you’ll know you're not alone.

This page was never meant to be seen.

— Tamas
